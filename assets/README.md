# Code Refactor

    The purpose of the following will be to improve on the the current codebase, making it more accessable for users 
with disabilites or socio-economic restrictions, as well as organizing the overall semantic strucute of the html 
and css. All edits made have been noted with in-code citations.

## Method

Inorder to champion accesability in the HTML and CSS code I was created by Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc I will be implementing several tactics. First adding alt tags to all images so those with visual impairments or those without access to proper internet services can still gleen information from the cite. Next I will be centering the text under 'Lead Generation', 'Brand Awareness' and 'Cost Management' as well as changing the text color to black and outlining it to make it easier to read. 

## Tools Used
